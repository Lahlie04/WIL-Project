I am an IT student majoring in Software Development at the Tshwane University of Technology, reason I chose to do Information Technology is that it is exciting yet challenging to do and love a challenge that will pull out the great outmost in me.
Being in this field of study has allowed me to work with different people and understand how people are as we are different in how we think and do things.
